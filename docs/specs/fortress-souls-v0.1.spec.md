# Fortress Souls v0.1 Implementation Scaffold

## Codex-Ready Specification, Research Plan, and Backlog

**Status:** Draft
**Document version:** 0.1
**Target implementation version:** Fortress Souls v0.1
**Audience:** Codex / GPT-5.5 / GPT-5.4 implementation agents working one backlog item at a time
**Architecture style:** Modular monolith in a monorepo
**Primary outcome:** A local web app lets the player select a dwarf from a live or mocked Dwarf Fortress source and chat with that dwarf using an LLM, with no gameplay persistence, no tools, and no game mutation.

---

# 1. Product slice

## 1.1 v0.1 goal

Version 0.1 proves the smallest useful loop:

1. Start the local web app.
2. Connect to a Dwarf Fortress data source.
3. Show a list of dwarves.
4. Select one dwarf.
5. Extract a curated dwarf-state snapshot.
6. Assemble a prompt from:

   * base system prompt,
   * dwarf portrayal rules,
   * current dwarf state,
   * small static interpretation guide,
   * active in-memory conversation.
7. Send the prompt to an LLM provider.
8. Display the dwarf’s response.
9. Continue the chat during the current session.

The release is successful if the player says:

> “This dwarf feels somewhat grounded in the fortress.”

The release is not expected to solve memory, politics, perception, tool use, councils, promises, or in-game UI.

## 1.2 v0.1 non-goals

Version 0.1 explicitly excludes:

* persistent `SOUL.md`,
* persistent conversations,
* player promises,
* commitments,
* grievances,
* memory extraction,
* knowledge base,
* role-filtered knowledge,
* dwarf perception tools,
* `.look(...)`,
* `rememberStock(...)`,
* tool calling,
* agentic multi-step reasoning,
* councils,
* voting,
* proposed game actions,
* game-state mutation,
* in-game DFHack overlay,
* automatic background simulation.

No tiny throne rooms hidden under the floorboards. One room, one chair, one talking dwarf.

---

# 2. Architectural principles

## 2.1 The deterministic/probabilistic seam

Version 0.1 must preserve this boundary:

| Concern                   | Owner                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Dwarf state extraction    | Deterministic application code |
| Prompt assembly           | Deterministic application code |
| Configuration and secrets | Deterministic application code |
| LLM response generation   | Probabilistic model            |
| Displaying response       | Deterministic application code |
| Mutating Dwarf Fortress   | Not allowed in v0.1            |

The model may produce prose only.

The model must not receive direct access to DFHack commands, filesystem commands, shell commands, or write-capable game APIs.

## 2.2 Read-only by construction

Version 0.1 should make write actions impossible, not merely discouraged.

There should be no backend endpoint that mutates Dwarf Fortress.

There should be no model tool surface.

There should be no “execute arbitrary DFHack command” escape hatch.

If debugging requires raw DFHack command execution, it belongs outside the app in developer documentation, not in the product surface.

## 2.3 Modular monolith, not premature microservices

The backend is one deployable application with explicit internal modules.

Do not create separate services for:

* LLM provider,
* prompt assembler,
* dwarf adapter,
* observability,
* frontend backend-for-frontend.

Use separate modules/projects/namespaces inside one backend process.

The architecture should make later extraction possible without performing it now.

## 2.4 Monorepo

All source, docs, tests, agent primitives, scripts, and local orchestration live in one repository.

The repository is the unit Codex should understand.

## 2.5 Instrumentation first

Observability is part of v0.1, not a luxury.

The first working slice must expose enough telemetry to answer:

* Did the app connect to the data source?
* How long did dwarf listing take?
* How long did snapshot extraction take?
* What model provider was used?
* How long did the LLM call take?
* Did prompt assembly fail?
* Was the failure in DFHack, the backend, the provider, or the browser?

Logs alone are not sufficient. Use structured logs, traces, and basic metrics.

---

# 3. Recommended technology stack

## 3.1 Backend

Use:

* .NET 10 LTS,
* ASP.NET Core,
* C#,
* modular monolith structure,
* OpenTelemetry,
* structured logging,
* xUnit or equivalent test framework.

Why:

* strong fit for the user’s background,
* good local API development,
* good observability support,
* simple modular monolith structure,
* easy later move to richer orchestration.

## 3.2 Frontend

Use:

* TypeScript,
* React,
* Vite,
* TanStack Query or a similarly lightweight query layer,
* plain CSS or a minimal component library.

Avoid heavy UI frameworks in v0.1 unless the implementation agent can justify the added complexity.

The UI is simple:

* connection status,
* dwarf list,
* selected dwarf panel,
* snapshot debug panel,
* chat panel,
* provider error display.

## 3.3 Local orchestration

Use one of these, in order of preference:

1. **Aspire AppHost** for local orchestration and dashboard-friendly developer experience.
2. **Docker Compose** with Aspire Dashboard standalone or OpenTelemetry Collector.
3. Plain scripts if Docker/Aspire causes friction.

Important:

* Do not let orchestration choices turn the app into microservices.
* Aspire or Docker Compose is local scaffolding, not a distributed architecture mandate.

## 3.4 Observability

Use:

* OpenTelemetry traces,
* OpenTelemetry metrics,
* structured logs,
* OTLP export,
* Aspire Dashboard for local inspection if practical.

Minimum custom spans:

```text
fortresssouls.dwarves.list
fortresssouls.dwarves.snapshot
fortresssouls.prompt.assemble
fortresssouls.llm.chat
fortresssouls.chat.turn
```

Minimum metrics:

```text
fortresssouls.dwarves.list.duration
fortresssouls.dwarves.snapshot.duration
fortresssouls.prompt.tokens.estimated
fortresssouls.llm.request.duration
fortresssouls.llm.request.count
fortresssouls.llm.error.count
```

Minimum structured log fields:

```text
correlationId
sessionId
dwarfId
snapshotSchemaVersion
providerType
model
operation
durationMs
errorCode
```

## 3.5 LLM provider

v0.1 should support:

1. `FakeLlmProvider` for tests and offline UI development.
2. One real provider:

   * preferably OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoint, or
   * OpenAI provider using current recommended API shape.

Provider-specific DTOs must not leak into domain modules.

The domain-level interface should be simple:

```csharp
public interface IChatProvider
{
    Task<ChatProviderResult> SendAsync(
        ChatProviderRequest request,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken);
}
```

## 3.6 Dwarf Fortress adapter

v0.1 should support:

1. `FakeDwarfFortressAdapter`
2. `JsonFileDwarfFortressAdapter`
3. `DfHackDwarfFortressAdapter`

The fake adapter comes first. The real adapter comes after the API and UI are stable.

The fake adapter is not “throwaway.” It is a permanent testing primitive.

# 5. PROSE implementation plan

The repo should be instrumented for agentic development before feature work begins.

This avoids the classic pattern where the first ten Codex tasks create ten architectural styles. Small tragedy, very modern.

## 5.1 Progressive Disclosure

Do not put all guidance in root `AGENTS.md`.

Root `AGENTS.md` should:

* state project purpose,
* state global safety rules,
* state command entry points,
* point to relevant docs,
* point to agent primitives,
* tell Codex when to load deeper context.

Example principle:

```text
If working on DFHack integration, read:
- docs/research/dfhack-command-invocation.md
- agent/instructions/dfhack.instructions.md
- agent/skills/dfhack-adapter-safety/SKILL.md
```

## 5.2 Reduced Scope

Each backlog item must be sized so a single Codex session can complete it without needing to redesign the whole project.

A backlog item is too large if it requires all three at once:

* backend implementation,
* frontend implementation,
* DFHack integration,
* LLM provider integration,
* observability,
* test strategy changes,
* architecture decision.

Prefer one primary module plus one integration edge.

## 5.3 Orchestrated Composition

Use primitives as separate files:

| Primitive           | Purpose                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `AGENTS.md`         | always-on Codex project guidance             |
| `*.instructions.md` | scoped engineering rules                     |
| `*.agent.md`        | specialist roles                             |
| `SKILL.md`          | reusable decision frameworks                 |
| `*.prompt.md`       | repeatable Codex workflows                   |
| `*.spec.md`         | execution-ready feature specs                |
| `project.memory.md` | cross-session project decisions              |
| hooks docs          | event-triggered checks, even if manual first |

Do not build one giant instruction file. That way lies swamp architecture.

## 5.4 Safety Boundaries

Codex work must follow these boundaries:

* No destructive commands unless explicitly requested.
* No dependency upgrades unless the backlog item requires them.
* No secrets in code, tests, logs, screenshots, or docs.
* No game-state mutation endpoints in v0.1.
* No direct model-to-DFHack command execution.
* No “temporary” all-powerful debugging endpoint.

When a task touches safety-relevant areas, Codex must stop and summarize before proceeding:

* DFHack command execution,
* LLM provider secrets,
* shell process invocation,
* filesystem paths,
* telemetry containing prompts or responses,
* future write-capable game APIs.

## 5.5 Explicit Hierarchy

Instruction hierarchy:

```text
Root AGENTS.md
  ↓
docs/specs/fortress-souls-v0.1.spec.md
  ↓
module-specific instructions
  ↓
skill-specific decision framework
  ↓
current backlog item
```

For example, a prompt assembly task should load:

```text
AGENTS.md
docs/specs/prompt-contract-v0.1.md
agent/instructions/prompting.instructions.md
agent/skills/prompt-contracts/SKILL.md
docs/backlog/v0.1-backlog.md#relevant-item
```

---

# 6. Codex operating protocol

Each Codex session should use the same execution protocol.

## 6.1 Start protocol

Codex must begin each backlog item by doing this:

```text
1. Read AGENTS.md.
2. Read the target backlog item.
3. Read only the referenced docs and primitives.
4. Inspect existing code before editing.
5. State the intended implementation plan.
6. Implement only the requested item.
7. Run relevant tests and checks.
8. Summarize changed files, validation results, and next recommended item.
```

## 6.2 Stop conditions

Codex must stop and ask for human decision if:

* the task requires changing architecture direction,
* a dependency choice is ambiguous and materially consequential,
* DFHack invocation cannot be verified,
* a command could mutate game state,
* secrets would be required but no configuration pattern exists,
* test failure appears unrelated to the current task,
* implementation requires broad refactoring outside the backlog item.

## 6.3 Completion contract

Every backlog item must end with:

```text
Implementation summary
Changed files
Validation run
Known limitations
Recommended next task
```

If tests were not run, Codex must state why.

No “looks good to me” fog machine.

---

# 9. Prompt contract v0.1

## 9.1 Prompt structure

```text
SYSTEM:
You portray a specific dwarf from a Dwarf Fortress settlement.

Rules:
- Use only the supplied dwarf state and active conversation.
- Do not claim to know current surroundings unless the state says so.
- Do not claim that actions happened unless the state says so.
- Do not invent game events.
- Do not act as a generic assistant.
- If uncertain, say so in character.
- You may have opinions based on supplied personality, work, needs, and values.
- Keep responses concise unless the player asks for detail.

DWARF STATE:
{curated JSON or markdown summary}

INTERPRETATION GUIDE:
{small static guide}

CONVERSATION:
{recent in-memory messages}

PLAYER:
{current message}
```

## 9.2 Prompt assembly rules

The prompt assembler must:

* include selected dwarf state,
* include only the current session conversation,
* include no persistent memory,
* include no tool descriptions,
* include no hidden full fortress state,
* include no API keys,
* include no raw DFHack data unless developer mode explicitly enables it.

## 9.3 Static interpretation guide

Start small.

Example:

```text
Trait values are approximate and may be incomplete.
High assertiveness means the dwarf may openly disagree.
High anxiety means the dwarf may worry about risks.
High orderliness means the dwarf prefers plans, routines, and tidy work.
High anger means the dwarf may react sharply to frustration.
High dutifulness means the dwarf takes obligations seriously.
```

Do not pretend the guide is complete. v0.1 should evolve by observing bad dwarf responses.

---

# 10. Observability contract v0.1

## 10.1 Trace spans

Create spans for:

```text
HTTP request
  fortresssouls.dwarves.list
  fortresssouls.dwarves.snapshot
  fortresssouls.chat.turn
    fortresssouls.prompt.assemble
    fortresssouls.llm.chat
```

## 10.2 Span tags

Use tags such as:

```text
fortresssouls.adapter.type
fortresssouls.provider.type
fortresssouls.llm.model
fortresssouls.dwarf.id
fortresssouls.snapshot.schema_version
fortresssouls.prompt.template_version
fortresssouls.chat.session_id
```

Do not tag full prompt text by default.

## 10.3 Logging

Log at `Information`:

* app startup,
* adapter selected,
* provider selected,
* dwarf list loaded,
* snapshot loaded,
* chat turn completed.

Log at `Warning`:

* adapter unavailable,
* provider unavailable,
* prompt too large,
* invalid session,
* snapshot missing optional fields.

Log at `Error`:

* DFHack command failed,
* provider request failed,
* unhandled API error.

## 10.4 Redaction

Never log:

* API keys,
* Authorization headers,
* full provider request headers,
* full prompts by default,
* full LLM responses by default if telemetry export may leave the machine.

Developer prompt inspection is allowed in the UI, but should be explicit.

---

# 11. Testing strategy

## 11.1 Backend tests

Required:

* unit tests for prompt assembly,
* unit tests for fake adapter,
* unit tests for provider abstraction with fake provider,
* API integration tests for health, dwarf list, snapshot, and chat send,
* snapshot schema golden tests.

## 11.2 Frontend tests

Required:

* smoke test rendering app shell,
* test dwarf list loading state,
* test selecting a dwarf,
* test chat input/send flow with mocked API.

## 11.3 End-to-end tests

v0.1 should have one fake end-to-end smoke test:

```text
Given fake dwarves are available
When the player selects Urist
And sends “What are you doing?”
Then the UI shows an assistant response
And the diagnostics panel shows adapter and provider metadata
```

Real DFHack end-to-end testing may remain manual in v0.1, but must have a runbook.

## 11.4 Golden files

Use golden files for:

* sample dwarf list JSON,
* sample dwarf snapshot JSON,
* assembled prompt for sample dwarf,
* fake provider response.

Golden files make Codex changes reviewable. If the prompt changes, the diff should show exactly how.

# 12. Research plan

Research items should be performed before or alongside implementation, but they should produce small written outputs.

## R-001: DFHack invocation options

Question:

> What is the safest and simplest v0.1 path for the backend to obtain dwarf data from DFHack?

Investigate:

* `dfhack-run`,
* DFHack remote API,
* Lua scripts as commands,
* command stdout behaviour,
* JSON output feasibility,
* Windows path assumptions,
* Steam DF install path assumptions.

Output:

```text
docs/research/dfhack-command-invocation.md
docs/decisions/adr-0003-dfhack-adapter.md
```

Decision required:

```text
Use dfhack-run + Lua JSON scripts for v0.1
or
Use DFHack remote API directly for v0.1
or
Delay real DFHack adapter and use JSON-file adapter first
```

Recommended default:

> Use fake and JSON-file adapters first. Then implement `dfhack-run` + Lua scripts as the first real adapter, unless research shows this path is brittle.

## R-002: Dwarf field mapping

Question:

> Which DFHack/Lua fields are reliable enough for v0.1 dwarf identity and state?

Investigate fields for:

* unit id,
* visible name,
* profession,
* current job,
* skills,
* labors,
* traits,
* values,
* needs,
* stress,
* wounds,
* relationships if easy.

Output:

```text
docs/research/dfhack-field-map.md
dfhack/samples/dwarf-snapshot.sample.json
```

Rule:

> Prefer a small reliable snapshot over a huge unreliable one.

## R-003: LLM provider strategy

Question:

> What real provider should v0.1 implement first?

Options:

* OpenAI provider,
* OpenAI-compatible provider,
* local OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

Output:

```text
docs/research/llm-provider-options.md
docs/runbooks/provider-configuration.md
```

Recommended default:

> Implement `FakeChatProvider` first, then `OpenAiCompatibleChatProvider` because it also helps local model support.

## R-004: Local observability path

Question:

> Should local dev use Aspire AppHost, Aspire Dashboard standalone, Docker Compose, or plain console exporters?

Output:

```text
docs/decisions/adr-0004-observability.md
docs/runbooks/local-dev.md
```

Recommended default:

> Use OpenTelemetry in the app regardless. Use Aspire Dashboard if it stays simple. Do not block v0.1 on perfect dashboard integration.

# 13. Backlog sizing rules

Each backlog item has a size:

| Size | Meaning                                                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| S    | touches one module or one doc area                            |
| M    | touches one module plus tests, or two closely related modules |
| L    | touches two to three modules with integration tests           |
| XL   | too large for one Codex session; split before implementation  |

Target most tasks as **M** or **L**.

Avoid tiny tasks like “create one interface” unless they are part of a scaffolding item.

Avoid XL tasks. If a task feels XL, split by seam:

* backend before frontend,
* fake before real adapter,
* contract before implementation,
* implementation before observability polish,
* prompt assembly before real provider.

---

# 14. Backlog item template

# 16. Recommended Codex prompts

## 16.1 Standard implementation prompt

```text
Read AGENTS.md, then implement backlog item B-XXX from docs/backlog/v0.1-backlog.md.

Follow the project’s PROSE structure:
- Load only the context referenced by the backlog item.
- Keep scope reduced to this item.
- Respect modular monolith boundaries.
- Do not add persistence, tools, or game mutation for v0.1.
- Add or update tests required by the acceptance criteria.
- Run the listed validation commands.

Before editing, summarize your implementation plan.
After editing, summarize changed files, validation results, limitations, and the recommended next backlog item.
```

## 16.2 Research prompt

```text
Read AGENTS.md and run the research spike for R-XXX.

Produce the requested research document and ADR if applicable.
Do not implement production code unless the backlog item explicitly asks for it.
Distinguish verified facts, assumptions, risks, and recommendations.
End with a clear decision proposal.
```

## 16.3 Review prompt

```text
Read AGENTS.md and review the implementation of backlog item B-XXX.

Do not modify files unless asked.
Check:
- scope compliance,
- architecture boundaries,
- safety boundaries,
- tests,
- observability,
- documentation drift.

Return findings grouped by severity.
```

B-016 real provider choice
B-018 DFHack invocation decision
B-019 DFHack Lua script prototype
B-021 DFHack process adapter
B-025 v0.1 release review

# 18. Definition of Done for v0.1

v0.1 is done when:

* [ ] A local web app starts.
* [ ] Backend health is visible.
* [ ] Dwarf list loads from fake adapter.
* [ ] Dwarf list can load from real DFHack adapter if configured, or JSON-file adapter if live DFHack remains unresolved.
* [ ] Player can select a dwarf.
* [ ] Player can view current dwarf snapshot.
* [ ] Player can chat with the dwarf.
* [ ] Chat uses selected dwarf state in the prompt.
* [ ] Chat is in-memory only.
* [ ] Fake provider works without secrets.
* [ ] One real provider works when configured.
* [ ] Observability emits logs, traces, and basic metrics.
* [ ] Prompt preview exists in developer mode.
* [ ] No game mutation exists.
* [ ] No model tools exist.
* [ ] No persistent gameplay memory exists.
* [ ] README explains fake mode, provider mode, and DFHack mode.
* [ ] Tests pass.

# 19. v0.1 anti-patterns

Reject these during review:

## 19.1 The omnipotent debug endpoint

```text
POST /api/dfhack/execute
```

This must not exist.

## 19.2 The accidental database

Adding SQLite “just for chat history” violates v0.1.

## 19.3 The clever prompt blob

A single enormous prompt template containing all future ambitions is wrong.

v0.1 prompt should be small.

## 19.4 The provider-shaped domain

Do not make OpenAI DTOs the internal chat model.

## 19.5 The fake adapter as trash

The fake adapter is a testing primitive. Keep it clean.

## 19.6 Observability after the fact

Adding logs at the end is archaeology, not engineering.

## 19.7 Real DFHack first

Do not block the app architecture on live game integration. Build fake and JSON-file adapters first, then attach DFHack.

---

# 20. First five Codex tasks to run

Run these first, in order:

```text
B-001 Create monorepo skeleton and root agent guidance
B-002 Add PROSE primitive files for v0.1 development
B-003 Record stack and architecture ADRs
B-004 Create backend solution skeleton
B-005 Add OpenTelemetry and structured logging baseline
```

Only after that should Codex build dwarf features.

The purpose is to establish the rails before asking the little code-goblin to push the minecart.
