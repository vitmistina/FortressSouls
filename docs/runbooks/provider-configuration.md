# Provider Configuration Runbook

Status: Draft  
Applies to: v0.1 real provider mode  
Provider: OpenRouter through OpenAI-compatible HTTP API

## Default provider

v0.1 uses `FakeChatProvider` by default.

The first real provider target is:

```text
ProviderType = OpenAiCompatible
Endpoint = https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
Model = deepseek/deepseek-v3.2
```

## Root config plus .env

Keep the non-secret provider settings in `fortress-souls.config.jsonc` and the
API key in `.env`.

Fortress Souls supports one secret-loading seam for the provider key:
`FortressSouls__Llm__ApiKey`. The `scripts/dev.*` entry points load that name
from `.env` into the app process. A raw PowerShell session does not read `.env`
automatically, so the manual smoke commands below must set the same variable in
the current shell.

In `fortress-souls.config.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  "llm": {
    "providerType": "OpenAiCompatible",
    "endpoint": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2",
    "maxOutputTokens": 500,
    "temperature": 0.85,
    "timeoutSeconds": 45,
  },
}
```

In `.env`:

```powershell
FortressSouls__Llm__ApiKey=
```

For fake mode:

```powershell
// llm.providerType = "Fake"
```

`scripts/dev.*` reads the root config plus `.env` and projects them into the
existing application environment-variable seams.

## Manual OpenRouter smoke test

Use this before implementing or debugging the provider adapter.

```powershell
$env:FortressSouls__Llm__ApiKey = ""

$body = @{
  model = "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2"
  messages = @(
    @{
      role = "system"
      content = "You portray a Dwarf Fortress dwarf. Stay concise and in character."
    },
    @{
      role = "user"
      content = "You are Urist, a tired miner. Why are you unhappy?"
    }
  )
  temperature = 0.85
  max_tokens = 300
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10

Invoke-RestMethod `
  -Uri "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions" `
  -Method Post `
  -Headers @{
    "Authorization" = "Bearer $env:FortressSouls__Llm__ApiKey"
    "Content-Type" = "application/json"
    "HTTP-Referer" = "http://localhost:5173"
    "X-Title" = "FortressSouls"
  } `
  -Body $body
```

## Expected result

The response should contain one assistant message with concise in-character
dwarf prose.

The exact phrasing is not important. This test only proves:

- the API key works,
- the endpoint works,
- the model slug works,
- the request shape is accepted,
- the model returns plain chat text.

## Manual OpenRouter tool-call smoke test for R2-001

Use this to reproduce the retained live proof for
`docs/backlog/v0.2-backlog.md#r2-001`. The captured 2026-06-22 evidence is in
`docs/research/r2-001-openrouter-tool-loop-live-proof-2026-06-22.md`.
Run the same seam only after a valid provider API key has been made available
through `FortressSouls__Llm__ApiKey`. If you store it in `.env`, load it
through `scripts/dev.*` first. If you run the commands directly in PowerShell,
set the same variable in that shell.

If the key is missing, stop here.

```powershell
$env:FortressSouls__Llm__ApiKey = ""

$messages = @(
  @{
    role = "system"
    content = "Use the provided function when current structured data is needed. Reply briefly after tool use."
  },
  @{
    role = "user"
    content = "What do you see near the ore bins?"
  }
)

$tools = @(
  @{
    type = "function"
    function = @{
      name = "probe_observe"
      description = "Return a deterministic observation for the Fortress Souls R2-001 spike."
      parameters = @{
        type = "object"
        additionalProperties = $false
        properties = @{
          subject = @{ type = "string" }
          repeatCount = @{ type = "integer"; minimum = 1; maximum = 4 }
          emitLargePayload = @{ type = "boolean" }
          delayMs = @{ type = "integer"; minimum = 0; maximum = 10000 }
        }
        required = @("subject", "repeatCount", "emitLargePayload", "delayMs")
      }
    }
  }
)

$body1 = @{
  model = "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2"
  messages = $messages
  tools = $tools
  tool_choice = "auto"
  parallel_tool_calls = $false
  temperature = 0
  max_tokens = 256
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 12

$response1 = Invoke-RestMethod `
  -Uri "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions" `
  -Method Post `
  -Headers @{
    "Authorization" = "Bearer $env:FortressSouls__Llm__ApiKey"
    "Content-Type" = "application/json"
    "HTTP-Referer" = "http://localhost:5173"
    "X-Title" = "FortressSouls"
  } `
  -Body $body1

$toolCall = $response1.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0]

$toolResult = @{
  schemaVersion = "probe.v1"
  summary = "ore bins ore bins"
} | ConvertTo-Json -Compress

$messages2 = @(
  $messages
  @{
    role = "assistant"
    content = $null
    tool_calls = @($toolCall)
  }
  @{
    role = "tool"
    tool_call_id = $toolCall.id
    content = $toolResult
  }
)

$body2 = @{
  model = "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2"
  messages = $messages2
  tools = $tools
  tool_choice = "auto"
  parallel_tool_calls = $false
  temperature = 0
  max_tokens = 256
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 12

$response2 = Invoke-RestMethod `
  -Uri "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions" `
  -Method Post `
  -Headers @{
    "Authorization" = "Bearer $env:FortressSouls__Llm__ApiKey"
    "Content-Type" = "application/json"
    "HTTP-Referer" = "http://localhost:5173"
    "X-Title" = "FortressSouls"
  } `
  -Body $body2

$response1
$response2
```

Expected live-proof result:

- the first response returns one `tool_calls` entry for `probe_observe`,
- the second response returns one assistant message with prose and no further
  tool call,
- no raw tool arguments or tool results are copied into default application
  telemetry.

Retain only redacted request/response evidence. The existing 2026-06-22
retained artifact also records an important nuance from the current
`deepseek/deepseek-v3.2` path: the raw endpoint accepted the tool-call wire
shape, but the repository adapter needed explicit deterministic tool-use
instruction to elicit the live call reliably from the probe harness.

## Provider status API

Read runtime status without triggering any provider network call:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5230/api/provider/status"
```

The response is an allowlisted safe projection of:

- provider type,
- configured model slug,
- configured and readiness booleans,
- last outcome and stable error category,
- bounded duration and timestamp metadata.

The status response never includes API keys, Authorization headers,
prompt/response content, or raw provider request or response bodies.

## Safety rules

Never commit:

- real API keys,
- Authorization headers,
- full provider request logs,
- full prompt logs by default,
- full LLM responses in telemetry by default.

Never expose secrets through:

- health endpoint,
- provider status endpoint,
- frontend diagnostics,
- exception messages,
- structured logs,
- trace tags.

## Recommended v0.1 defaults

```text
MaxOutputTokens = 500
Temperature = 0.85
TimeoutSeconds = 45
```

For normal dwarf chat, avoid excessive output limits. A dwarf does not need
4,000 tokens to complain about hauling rocks. That way lies invoice-shaped
slapstick.

## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized

Likely causes:

- missing API key,
- wrong environment variable,
- copied key with whitespace,
- OpenRouter account not funded,
- key revoked.

Safe presence checks:

```powershell
-not [string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace($env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY)
-not [string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace($env:FortressSouls__Llm__ApiKey)
```

`False` means the variable is missing or blank. Do not print the secret values.

If the UI or API returns a safe failure, keep the displayed
`X-Correlation-ID` and inspect logs or traces by that ID.

### 404 Model not found

Likely causes:

- model slug changed,
- model temporarily unavailable,
- wrong endpoint,
- provider routing issue.

First adjustment:

```text
Check the model slug in OpenRouter.
```

### Timeout

Likely causes:

- provider latency,
- overloaded model,
- too high `MaxOutputTokens`,
- network issue.

First adjustment:

```text
Lower MaxOutputTokens to 300.
```

### Response is too verbose

Lower:

```text
MaxOutputTokens
Temperature
```

Also strengthen the prompt rule:

```text
Keep responses concise unless the player asks for detail.
```

### Response is too generic

Check whether the prompt includes:

- selected dwarf identity,
- profession,
- current job,
- personality traits,
- needs,
- recent conversation.

Generic model output is often not a provider problem. It is usually a thin
prompt with a decorative beard.
